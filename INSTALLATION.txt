I would be very surprised, if the project could just be run out of the box.  

Download and install:
- PostgreSQL
- PostGIS Spatial Extension (important!)
- PgAdmin (technically not necessary, but very useful for confirming that the installation works.)

When installing the Stack Builder should say that "Selected Packages" includes "PostGIS ... Bundle for PostgreSQL ..."
Click "Next" to download. (this takes quite a while...)
Click "Next" to install. 
Read the License for PostGIS, and click "I Agree".
Check components to install:
- PostGIS
You will have another opportunity to create the database here as well. 
Click "Install"

If it asks to install any drivers, click "Yes".


Use as reference: https://www.postgis.net/workshops/postgis-intro/installation.html

Open PgAdmin. 
Use the password it asked you to set. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IF A POSTGRESQL SERVER WITH THE NAME "postgres" DOES NOT EXIST 
Under "Browsers" (left), if no server exists.
- Right-click "Servers" -> Create -> Server...

Use as reference: https://www.postgis.net/workshops/postgis-intro/creating_db.html

Naming:
-------
Host name: localhost
Port: 5432
Maintenance database: postgres 
User: postgres
Password: g37TbukJZ
-------
If you named these values anything else, you will have to manually change the values in 'db/knexfile.js' to whatever you made them.
-------

Expand "Servers"->"PostgreSQL 15" (or whatever)
Right-click "Databases"->"Create"->"Database..."

Naming:
-------
Database: postgres
Owner: postgres
-------
Now you need to enable to PostgreSQL database. 

Now to ensure everything works properly...
Click drop-down "Tools" -> "Query Tool"
Run the script in 'db/sql/extensiongis.sql'. It contains:
```
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
CREATE EXTENSION postgis_topology;
SELECT postgis_full_version();
```
If the query successfully runs, you have installed PostGIS correctly. 
It should tell you some information about the installation.
You can now run Knex.js migrations to set up the tables.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Open up a terminal and navigate to the folder of this project.

First, install *all* packages for the project.
> npm install

First command is to set up the knex migration, tables, and constraints.
> npm run migrate
If everything went correctly, it should print, that a bunch of tables have been created, and then print an error. 

Optionally, you can now populate the database with some "fake" measurements. 
> npm run seed
Then, you can safely run the project.
> npm run start
